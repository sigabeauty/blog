Indeed, VAD is very important in any production of speech data pre-processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="task-definition">Task Definition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Voice activity detection is the task of looking for voice activity in an audio stream. Basically, it should tell speech apart from noise and silence. Given input audio feature X, the task of VAD is the predict Y, each Y_i is the probability of speech or noise/silence in current time. Here, the definition of X and Y is generalized in terms of time granularity(Can represent both audio chunk, frame, etc).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
